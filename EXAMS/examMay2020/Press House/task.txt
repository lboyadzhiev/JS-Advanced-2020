Problem 2. Press House
Your Task
Your need to create several classes for Press House. Implement the following classes: 
Article, ShortReports, BookReview.
Article
constructor(title, content)
Should have these 2 properties:
    • title – string 
    • content – string  
toString()
This function should return the title and the content:
" Title: {title}
Content: {content}"
ShortReports
Class ShortReports inherits class Article.
constructor(title, content, originalResearch)
Should have these 4 properties:
    • title – string,  
    • content – string, 
    • originalResearches – object with properties title and author
    • comments – array of strings
As we create a short reports here we have a length limit for the content property – it should be less than 150 symbols, otherwise throw an error with the next message:
 "Short reports content should be less then 150 symbols."
The property should have the both required properties , otherwise throw error with this message: 
"The original research should have author and title."
addComment(comment)
This function should receive single comment like string, add it to the comments array and return a message:
"The comment is added."
toString()
This function should extend the toString method of class Article adding same more lines like:
" "
And if there are any comments you should print on a new line 
"Comments:" 
and then all comments each on a new line.
Note:  For more information see the examples below! 
BookRewiew
Class BookReview inherits class Article.
constructor(title, content, book)
Should have these 4 properties:
    • title – string,  
    • content – string, 
    • book – object with properties name and author,
    • clients – array of objects,
The client object should have the following structure {clientName, orderDescription}.
addClient(clientName,  orderDescription)
This function should receive clientName and orderDescription as strings. Here you should check our clients array and if we already have this order from the same client throw error with next message: 
"This client has already ordered this review."
Otherwise we add our client object into the clients array and return a message:
"{ clientName } has ordered a review for { book name }"
toString() 
This function should extend the toString() method of class Article adding same more lines like:
"Book: { book name }"
And if there are any orders you should print all orders each on a new line:
"Orders:
{ clientName } - { orderDescription }"
